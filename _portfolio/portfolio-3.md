Team Project
============
A team-based project in which I was the Lead Developer, Project was purely based on a restaurant management system
programmed in Java: This was an exciting experience for me, as it was one of the first times in which I worked in
an entire group with various different skill levels, being able to manage and conduct different tasks was a skill that
I learned from this; this was a fundamental project to my core, and I believe that what I  have gained will be fruitful going onwards to my masters.

Memory Management System
=========================
This was another rather exciting project, a creating / emulating a memory management system for applications was very
interesting, using complex data structures and different tools like make. My core love for C was derived through
this project.
