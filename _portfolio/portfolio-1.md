PNP(PlugNPlay) Database
============================
One of my goals is to be able to create a dataset; this can be seen in my more research-intensive projects like the
self-learning chatbot to my facial recognition, in which I wanted to scrape data or update the current knowledge base.

This project was one of my more interesting ones, using more advance pythonic tools like asyncio to scrap GitHub and
return a JSON file of all possible *Neovim*  plugins on GitHub at this moment

Neovim
=======
Neovim is a considerable part of my life; as a personal development editor (pde), I use this for daily life, from note-taking to
creating multiple projects. For me being able to develop a plugin to help me create a project the way I want is truly
Beautiful, such that I have been a part of this fantastic community for an extended period.

Facial recognition Project
===
Visualization and prediction over an evergrowing dataset with complete GUI interactions: this was my first ever project that I worked on. 
This was a combination of multiple resources. That eventually led me to create a relatively simple facial rec.

NeorgBot
========
Currently maintaining a discord bot written in python3.10 for the Neorg project [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) [Neorg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg)

=============
An ongoing project to create an API for youtube music

Drone Detection System
====================
Python drone detection system: using real-time detection systems to allow automatic vision tracking: This was initially
created with cascades and then further moved to an in-depth approach using Pytorch and CNN. It currently uses an open
source dataset provided by Stanford UAV / Dron DS
