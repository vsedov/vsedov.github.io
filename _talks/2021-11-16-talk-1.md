Participated as alumni of their previous challenges involving various natural language problems closely linked with Machine Learning. [link](https://www.gresearch.co.uk/blog/article/european-coding-challenge/) this event not only included natural Languages but a wide range of different challenges such as np problems and included a talk 
about new rising technologies.

The target of this challenge/talk was to be able to interact with the best competitors in the EU to solve relatively complex and
interesting problems. I found this to be a lovely progression regarding knowing how much further there is
to learn.
