Quick Blog
======
I hope to conduct academic research and earn a master’s in Machine Learning. In addition, I hope soon to fill these pages with unique blog posts and publications.
 In the long run, I want to apply my knowledge in the leading research and new developments introduced within this field. However, with the events of complex data processing interlinked with AI, I believe the future is nearer than we think. Seeing this happen before my eyes incites this drive to continue forward and be a part of this incredible adventure.

My goals going onwards from now is to solely be a part of this pathway through personal research to undergraduate projects and hopefully my masters.
