This is a tentative post to see what happens when scheduling the date in which it is published. It should appear on the first of June, 2021. 

It is also my first Blog post. I would like this to be a free area in which I can type down whatever comes to my mind. Respect will be always kept, but please keep in mind that as Twitter users state in their bio: "opinions are my own". I guarantee you that I will not be as hard as one of my favourite radio programs, "La Zanzara" on Radio24, but at the same time I will not be as soft as national television. I feel like one of the most important things in life is discussion and developing ideas, not necessarily for a profit. 

I still do not know if this will be a fixed activity, or more influenced by randomness, and what I will talk about, so I cannot really tell much. I like to reason about science, music, politics (not very often), and socially felt problems, so the topics could be very different. 

As previously stated, this is not showing off, but rather collecting thoughts to see what changes in years in terms of _writing_, _thinking_ and _seeing_.
